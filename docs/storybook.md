# Storybook integration

Polaris has Storybook integration for developing UI components separately in isolation environment, as an individual piece. This is useful tool for faster development and quicker iteration. Also, it's good to serve as a guide so we don't recreate a component someone else has done. The latter contributes to reusability.

### Create stories for native and web platform

Storybook integrates with Polaris and offers an easy solution to present the UI components on both native and web platforms. To create a new story you would need to create a subfolder called `stories` inside your component folder. Then use different filenames to target different platforms where you want to develop, view or test your components.

For example:

```bash
src/components/atoms/button
  - [â–¼] stories
    - button.stories.common.js
    - button.stories.native.js
    - button.stories.web.js
  - index.jsx
```

Storybook will read all files inside the `stories` folders and use them in Storybook explorer UI:

- `*.stories.native.js` file(s) will be used inside react storybook for Native platform `ios` and `android`.
- `*.stories.web.js` files(s) will be used inside react storybook for Web
- `*.stories.common.js` file(s) will be use to common stories for components that share same properties and functionality on all platforms native and web.

Stories in `.native.js` and `.common.js` must use `storiesOf` format due to `@storybook/react-native`. `.web.js` files may use the more declarative CSF format.

It is also not possible to use the `@storybooks/addon-docs` plugin as it is not compatible with `@storybook/react-native`. To work around this there is a custom set of components in `storybook/story-components` to facilitate documentation that works in both storiesOf and CSF formats. See the `src/components/atoms/button/stories/button.stories.common.js` for example usage.

Theme and routing are automatically added to the story when decorating a story with a story page. To define linked screens use a `screens` prop in `StoryPage` and then reference the screen in the `path` of the `Link` components. See the `atoms/link` story for an example.

### Run storybook configuration and settings

Storybook's configuration and support files located inside `/storybook` folder in root of Polaris.

`/storybook/storybook-components` - Storybook **web** stories decorators files used to wrap stories components and present them with better visuals inside explorer UI.

`/storybook/.storybook-web` - Storybook react for **web** configuration and support files

`/storybook` - Storybook **native** configuration and support files

`/storybook/storybook-components-native` - Storybook **native** stories decorators files used to wrap stories components and present them inside explorer UI.

### Run storybook for native and web platform

In Polaris you can run Storybook' stories for components separately on its own platform Native (ios, android) and Web.

#### Storybook Web (Browser)

On Web, it runs the standard Storybook Explorer Interface with npm command:

```bash
$ npm run storybook:web
```

After it runs, browser will open storybook's url at `http://localhost:9001`

#### Storybook Native (iOS, Android)

On Native it runs the Storybook Native Explorer Interface:

for `ios` run:

```bash
$ npm run storybook:ios
```

for `android` run:

```bash
$ npm run storybook:android
```

After it runs, Storybook Explorer Application will open on the native device or on the simulator/emulator.
