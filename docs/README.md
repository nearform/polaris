Polaris uses [Storybook](/docs/storybook.md) integration for developing UI components separately in an isolation environment, as an individual piece. By doing so it allows for faster, independant development of UI components, and acts as a useful reference point to help prevent duplication of work. Polaris adopts Atomic Design Patterns to construct front end components, whiic helps with the development of reusable components.
